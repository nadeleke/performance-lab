Hasty Experiment
=================

[Hasty Experiment](http://www.hastyexperiment.info/) is my big data project for the January 2016 session of [Insight Data Engineering](http://insightdataengineering.com/)


## Intro
**Hasty Experiment** is an open-source data pipeline that integrates with [DataMill](https://datamill.uwaterloo.ca/) for analysis of historical and current experiments.
It makes use of the following technologies:
- Apache Kafka 0.8.2.2
- Apache Cassandra 2.2.4
- Apache Spark 1.5.2
- Redis 3.0.6
- Webdis
- AWS S3
- Django 1.9.0 with the following frameworks: HighCharts, jQuery, Bootstrap

For an explanation of the DataMill infrastructure please read [DataMill: Rigorous Performance Evaluation Made Easy](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/sites/ca.embedded-software-group/files/uploads/files/icpe13-datamill.pdf)
and the most recent paper, [DataMill: A Distributed Heterogeneous Infrastructure for Robust Experimentation](http://yuguangzhang.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/document.pdf)

## Live Demo
A live demo is currently (February 2014) running at http://hastyexperiment.info
